# Moonshot

An interactive GeoGebra app to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Moon Landing.

A few things we may need:

Radius of earth: 6371km

Radius of moon: 1737.1km

Distance between earth and moon: Apogee: 405 696km, Perigee: 363 104km, Average: 384 400km

Mass of Earth: 5.972x10^24 kg

Mass of Moon: 7.348x10^22 kg

Gravitational constant G = 6.674×10^(−11)

F = G m1 m2/r^2

Do we want to make any simplifying assumptions:

Moon&#039;s orbit around the Earth is circular?
